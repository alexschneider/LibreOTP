#LibreOTP

This application is a fork of FreeOTP because it hasn't been maintained in over a year.
Some features that will be added are:

* Password and pin protection
* Fixed camera sensor on Marshmallow phones (e.g. Nexus 5x)
* Encrypted backup and restore option without requiring insane network permissions
* Pebble support
